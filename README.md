# aviation-safety-management-system
let me call this asms? would tend to the naming later. project live on: asms.nsisong.com

## Introduction
In this project, my plan is to manage and analyze safety reports and incident data in aviation using data mining and machine learning techniques I discovered.

## Dir Mapping
- `data/`: for the raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `src/`: wrote the source code for data ingestion, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and modeling hee.
- `tests/`: all unit tests req for the source code.
- `requirements.txt`: added a list of required libraries.
- `README.md`: you know what it is.
- `run.py`: well, has everything you'd want to run the asms.
